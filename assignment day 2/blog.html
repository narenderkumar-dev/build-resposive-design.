    <h1>WHAT LIES AHEAD- 100 YEARS IN FULLNESS OF TIME</h1> <br><br><br>
    <p>How do you think the world would be in 100 years from now? Would it be an ideal comfortable world to live in with a people flying in the sky? We never know, this may or may not happen but there’s always a herculean effort in the field of science and technology in order to achieve this classic type of world. Howbeit, this fantasy could even turn out to be an appalling nightmare where we will have to face a ghastly outcome of our own action. But the endeavors of hundreds of Einsteins working out there to lavish this world will never run waste and that cloudland dreamt by many would no longer be a castle in sky.</p><br>
    <h2>POPULACE SWEEPs HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE</h2><br>
    <p>Just imagine what would be the world’s population by 2121. Wouldn’t it be stupefying to know that the anticipated population of the world would be around 11 billion? Yes, that is the real number. 11 billion humans will be dwelling in every nook and cranny of this world. Accommodating these billions of people would be the toughest challenge. In a report commissioned by Samsung Express, they predicted that we all would live underwater, on the floating settlements, if this not preferable then there would be another alternative way in which innovative materials like carbon nanotubes and diamond filaments that are 169 times stronger than concrete are used to build giant skyscrapers. They will be built with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles.</p><br>
    <h2>GOODBYE TO HOUSEHOLD CHORES</h2><br>
    <p>Cheers to those technophiles who would shape our morrows into a piece of old tackle with no muss and fuss. Mom’s aiding cookware which are already invented by students of the Eindhoven University would be reachable for every common man. This system identifies the product available at home and sets forth all possible recipes and also, we don’t have to keep looking after the dish until its cooked. There would be a fashion mirror that would give us a make-up tips for any occasion. There would definitely be a 3-D sound system which would make us experience the rain forest or a sea atmosphere and also a bio adaptive lamp turns into our biological clock which will help us to wake up gently.</p><br>
    <h2>LET'S DRIVE TO WORK</h2><br>
    <p>In future we don’t have to wait for a bus, or deal with the most irritating traffic. There will surely be a flying car as in every sci-fi movie. The most likely scenario will be, us flying all by ourself like an iron man because the gravity industry manufacturers have developed individual jet suits that allows a person to travel in the sky at the crazy speed.</p><br>
    <h2>THERAPEUTICS FOR FLESH AND BLOOD</h2><br>
    <p>Most researchers are confident that many fundamental changes would take place in next 100 years in the field of medicine and there’s a very reason to believe them. It would be possible to create a bionic eye or contact lens that will be able to monitor glucose levels in people’s tiers. There can also be a nanoscale robot to deliver drugs to the targeted organs. The developmental gene therapy will help to determine the chronic and fatal diseases and work to prevent them. So, in future we may not get sick at all and there would also be an anti- aging drugs to prevent aging mechanism.</p><br>
    <h2>BREAD FOR BILLIONS</h2><br>
    <p>Do you have any idea about how the food will be dispensed to the 11 billion population of the world? Don’t you think our binging habits would change? Definitely, yes.  Doctors will invent the way to make sure that we don’t need food at all or it will be possible to get a dish in the form of small food pill. Since all the 11 billion need to eat, meat production will have to be made without causing any serious ecological disaster.It doesn’t mean that the fast food would disappear but then we will have plant-based burger which would taste and smell like a meat. Vegetable sauces and chicken strips based on soy and pea protein have already been created by a food industry company called impossible food. Meanwhile scientists are already producing synthetic meat grown in a laboratory from a cow steam cells. It is very likely that algae can solve the problem of food shortage.</p><br>
    <h2>CONCLUSION TO A GRUELING ERA</h2><br>
    <p>Beyond the shadow of doubt, science and technology would mitigate us to an extent that we would no longer have to grapple with the hassles that we are supposed to confront right at this time. Despite the reality that life is so dubious and unsure we have to strive hard for the betterment of our future and that would be the true grit of mankind.   </p><br>
